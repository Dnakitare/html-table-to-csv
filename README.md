# HTML to CSV Converter

This project provides a command-line tool to convert HTML tables to CSV files. The script reads an HTML file containing tables and extracts relevant data, which is then saved to a CSV file. This script is specifically tailored to extract pertient information from material list reports generated by Eagle Metal software.

## Features

- Parses HTML files and extracts table data.
- Aggregates and cleans the data.
- Converts lineal footage measurements from feet and inches to inches for aggregation, then back to feet and inches.
- Outputs the cleaned and aggregated data to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `beautifulsoup4` library
- `pandas` library

## Installation

### Using the Executable

To use the pre-built executable, follow these steps:

1. Download the `html_to_csv.exe` file from the `dist` directory.
2. Place the executable in the desired directory on your Windows machine.

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build the executable from the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/html-to-csv.git
    cd html-to-csv
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create the executable using PyInstaller:

    ```sh
    pyinstaller --onefile html_to_csv.py
    ```

    The executable will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

### Using the Executable

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the executable and your HTML file.
3. Run the executable with the HTML file as an argument:

    ```sh
    html_to_csv.exe input.html
    ```

4. The script will generate a CSV file with the same name as the input file, but with a `.csv` extension.

### Using the Python Script

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script and your HTML file.
3. Run the script with the HTML file as an argument:

    ```sh
    python html_to_csv.py input.html
    ```

4. The script will generate a CSV file with the same name as the input file, but with a `.csv` extension.

## Example

Given an HTML file `sample.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>SKU</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>12345</td>
            <td>Wood Plank</td>
            <td>10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>67890</td>
            <td>Plywood</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```
